Angular Pipes are used to transform data on a template, without writing a boilerplate code in a component.

A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to the desired output. It is like a filter in Angular 1 (AngularJS).

Generally, If we need to transform data, we write the code in the component, For example, we want to transform today’s date into a format like `'16 Apr 2018'` or `'16-04-2018'`
,We need to write separate code in the component.

So instead of writing separate boilerplate code, we can use the built-in pipe called `DatePipe` which will take input and transform it into the desired date format.

A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to a desired output. For example, let us take a pipe to transform a component birthday property into a human-friendly date using date pipe.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-birthday',
  template: `<p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>`
})
export class BirthdayComponent {
  birthday = new Date(2002, 6, 18); 
}
```
